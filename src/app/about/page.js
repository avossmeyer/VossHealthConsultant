              <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                Disability Claim Advocates was founded with a singular goal, to make the disability
                claims process accessible, affordable, and compassionate for everyone. This mission
                stems from the personal experiences of our founder, Ryan Beckmann.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                In his early 20s, Ryan was diagnosed with multiple chronic illnesses that significantly
                impacted his ability to work. Faced with the challenge of balancing his health alongside his
                employment, Ryan found himself navigating the complex world of medical leave policies
                and disability claims. The process was overwhelming and expensive.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                This experience, combined with witnessing his family&apos;s health related struggles, ignited Ryan&apos;s passion for advocacy. He established Disability Claim
                Advocates to ensure others wouldn&apos;t face the same barriers alone.
