Faced with the challenge of balancing his health with his employment, Ryan found himself navigating the complex world of medical leave policies and disability claims. The process was overwhelming and expensive, requiring him to hire a consultant to secure the benefits he was entitled to.",
        "This experience, combined with witnessing his family's struggles with cancer and mental health issues, ignited Ryan's passion for advocacy. He established Disability Claim Advocates to ensure others wouldn't face the same barriers alone."
