Our Founder's Journey - Advocacy Rooted in Personal Experience
Disability Claim Advocates was founded with a singular goal, to make the disability claims process accessible, affordable, and compassionate for everyone. This mission stems from the personal experiences of our founder, Ryan Beckmann.
In his early 20s, Ryan was diagnosed with multiple chronic illnesses that significantly impacted his ability to work. Faced with the challenge of balancing his health with his employment, Ryan found himself navigating the complex world of medical leave policies and disability claims. The process was overwhelming and expensive, requiring him to hire a consultant to secure the benefits he was entitled to.
This experience, combined with witnessing his family's struggles with cancer and mental health issues, ignited Ryan's passion for advocacy. He established Disability Claim Advocates to ensure others wouldn't face the same barriers alone.
